# Introduction to Programming Workshop

### Overview 

The workshop will run from January 10th to 12th before spring classes begin. The three-day workshop will provide the students with no prior experience with the basic programming skills required to take full advantage of YSE course offerings. The workshop will heavily focus on the programming language R, but it will introduce students to version control with GitHub (something that should be used with any programming project) and introduce students to Python (to demonstrate that the fundamental concepts hold across any programming language). 

Each day will consist of two lectures in the morning (60-80 minutes with a 30-minute break between), a mini problem set to practice the skills being learned, and open office hours in the afternoon for students to ask clarifying questions.
