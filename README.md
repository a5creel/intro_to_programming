# Introduction to Programming Workshop

### Overview 

The workshop will run from January 10th to 12th before spring classes begin. The three-day workshop will provide the students with no prior experience the basic programming skills required to take full advantage of YSE course offerings. The workshop will heavily focus on the programming language R, but it will introduce students to version control with GitHub (something that should be used with any programming project) and introduce students to Python (to demonstrate that the fundamental concepts hold across any programming language). 

Each day will consist of two lectures in the morning (60-80 minutes with a 30-minute break between), a mini problem set to practice the skills being learned, and open office hours in the afternoon for students to ask clarifying questions.

    - Why use GitHub
    - Create a GitHub account
    - Install, Set Up and Integrate Git with R Studio
    - "Clone" a GitHub "Repository" to your local machine
    - Make change, write commit messages and "push" back to GitHub
    - "Pull" changes from GitHub to local computer
    - "Fork" someone's GitHub Repository so you can make changes to their files locally 
    



# Problem Sets 

Navigate to the problem set folder to find the pdf and r markdown versions of the mini problem sets. They are designed to take around one hour and no more than two hours.
