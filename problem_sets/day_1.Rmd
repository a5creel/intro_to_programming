Introduction
This problem set is designed to reinforce the concepts you've learned in the R Tutorial. Try to solve each problem using the knowledge you've gained. If you get stuck, refer back to the tutorial or seek help from your instructor or peers.
s
Problem 1: Basic Operations
Create two numeric variables with any values and perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on them.
Assign the result of a division to a new variable and print it.

Problem 2: Working with Vectors
Create a numeric vector with at least 5 elements.
Compute the sum and mean of the vector.
Use a logical comparison to identify which elements of the vector are greater than the mean.

Problem 3: Basic Data Frame Manipulation
Create a data frame with at least 3 columns and 5 rows. The columns should include a mix of numeric, character, and logical data types.
Print the entire data frame.
Print only the second column of the data frame.

Problem 4: Loop and Function
Write a function that takes a numeric input and returns the square of the number.
Use a for loop to apply this function to each element of a numeric vector.
Store the results in a new vector and print it.

Problem 5: Conditional Logic
Using the data frame created in Problem 3, write an if statement inside a loop to perform a conditional operation (e.g., if a number in a numeric column is even, replace it with half its value).
Print the modified data frame.
